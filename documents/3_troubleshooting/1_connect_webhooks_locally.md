# How to connect to Tribe webhooks:
During local development, you need to connect to the webhook in order to recevie the events you specify in the dev portal.

In order to do that, you'll need a tool to forward the webhooks data through your APIs.

We'll be using **[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/)** to achieve this functionality.

### Instructions:
Follow the below instructions in order to setup the ngrok.

1. Download the ngrok for your operating system
2. Setup an account and authenticate your ngrok agent.
3. Intiaite the ngrok agent to the post your server listens to
Example:
```properties
ngrok http 4000
```
4. After running the previous command, you will see a URL generated by ngrok with the pattern like **_*.ngrok.io_**
5. Copy the URL and paste it into the webhook configuration URL in the dev portal.  
Example:
```properties
https://44d1-195-181-50-13.ngrok.io/hooks
```
With this, you will be bale to receive webhooks in the **/hooks** endpoint in your server.
