# Ideation:
The **bookmind** is a platform for individuals to exchange books.
There are thousand of books collecting dust in people's library and the application affords the opportunity to create a network of book exchange and also a social platform based on books.

> Slogan:  
> Here only your beautiful mind matters

The basic idea is that a person could post an offer for a book she/her wants to exchange and other people would reply to the post with a book they would like to exchange in return.

The most important criteria for the application is that it focuses on people's mind rather than their race, age, sex, gender, social status.

People will only choose to meet each other to exchange a book and have a friendly talk.
